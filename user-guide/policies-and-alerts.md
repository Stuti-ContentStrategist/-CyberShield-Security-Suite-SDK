# Policies & Alerts

Policies and Alerts allow administrators to define how CyberShield detects, classifies, and responds to security events. By configuring precise rules, teams can automate their response and minimize manual intervention.

***

#### 🧰 Creating Policies

1. Navigate to **Dashboard → Policies**.
2. Click **Create New Policy**.
3. Choose a **Trigger Condition** (e.g., “Unauthorized Access Attempt”).
4. Select an **Action** (e.g., “Quarantine Endpoint” or “Notify Admin”).
5. Save and activate the policy.

***

#### 🚨 Managing Alerts

* Alerts appear in real-time on the **Alerts Feed**.
* Each alert contains metadata such as source IP, event type, and resolution status.
* You can acknowledge, assign, or mute alerts from the dashboard directly.

***

#### 💡 Best Practice

Review inactive or redundant policies quarterly to ensure relevance and prevent alert fatigue.

🔔 You’ve learned how to fine-tune your alert settings and security policies — helping you stay focused on what truly matters.
