# Folder Structure

Understanding the folder structure helps you navigate, configure, and customize your **CyberShield SDK** project or deployment environment effectively. Each folder serves a defined role — from SDK initialization to logging, configuration, and security workflows.

***

### Default Project Layout

When you install and initialize the CyberShield SDK, your project directory resembles the following structure:

```bash
bash

cybershield-project/
├── config/
│   ├── credentials.yaml
│   ├── settings.json
│   └── logging.yaml
├── src/
│   ├── main.py / main.js
│   ├── modules/
│   │   ├── detection.py
│   │   └── response.py
│   └── utils/
│       └── helpers.py
├── logs/
│   ├── app.log
│   └── error.log
├── tests/
│   ├── test_connection.py
│   └── test_scan.py
├── requirements.txt / package.json
├── README.md
└── .env
```

### Folder Descriptions

| Folder / File                       | Purpose                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **config/**                         | Stores credentials, configuration files, and log settings.                                                |
| **config/credentials.yaml**         | Contains your API Key, Secret, and environment details. Keep this file secure and never commit it to Git. |
| **src/**                            | Main source directory for SDK scripts, automation, and integrations.                                      |
| **src/modules/**                    | Custom detection or response logic built on top of CyberShield SDK functions.                             |
| **src/utils/**                      | Utility scripts for data formatting, validation, or API helpers.                                          |
| **logs/**                           | Stores execution logs and error reports generated by SDK modules.                                         |
| **tests/**                          | Contains basic connectivity and health-check test scripts.                                                |
| **requirements.txt / package.json** | Manages SDK dependencies (Python / Node.js).                                                              |
| **.env**                            | Stores environment variables securely for local development.                                              |
| **README.md**                       | Project-level documentation or usage summary.                                                             |

> 💡 **Tip:** If you’re working in a shared repository, exclude sensitive files like `credentials.yaml` or `.env` in your `.gitignore`.

### Configuration Files

CyberShield uses YAML and JSON-based configuration files for flexible customization.

Example — `config/settings.json`:

```json
json

{
  "log_level": "info",
  "scan_interval": 30,
  "enable_mfa": true,
  "region": "us-east-1"
}
```

These settings control how the SDK interacts with the CyberShield API and how frequently it performs scans or synchronizations.

***

### Logging and Reports

All runtime and error logs are automatically written to the `logs/` directory.\
Logs include:

* **app.log** — routine execution logs
* **error.log** — SDK or API call exceptions
* **security.log** _(optional)_ — security events and anomalies

> 🧠 **Best practice:** Rotate logs periodically and archive them to your SIEM or centralized monitoring system.

***

### Testing Your Setup

Use the included test scripts to confirm connectivity and scanning functionality:

```bash
bash

python tests/test_connection.py
```

or

```bash
bash

npm run test:connection
```

Expected output:

```
✔ API Connection: Successful
✔ Authentication: Valid
✔ Threat Detection Module: Ready
```

✅ If all tests pass, your project structure and SDK initialization are correctly configured.
